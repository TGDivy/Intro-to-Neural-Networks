# Introduction to Neural Netowrks

The netowrks are based in Matlab.

This project follows the assignments from the coursera course by Stanford for Intro to Machine learning.
I have modified the assignments to develop some richer products.

The repository is helpful for anyone intersted in the mathematics behind the neural networks, and I recommend you to take the machine learning course by Stanford.

Like in the week 4 and 5, it deals with the classic hand digit image classification task, I modified it to incorporate datasets on alphabets, and also try different density of the nerual network.
